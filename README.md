# Cheesing TES3

In late 2023, I set out to cheese TES3 as hard as I could. But also as lazily as
I could. Laborious exploits and alchemical trickery were shunned. I wanted the
build to require as little button-pushing as possible, while also being able to
steamroll through every corner of Vvardenfell, Mournhold, and Solstheim. Like
speedrunning, but minimizing number of inputs rather than minimizing time.

I succeeded.

What follows here is a very rough guide to repeat what I did, but more lazily
and more powerfully. More cheesily.

If you like RP builds, this is probably not an approach you would like. I
wouldn't say I did no RP, but the most RP thing I did was to be an extremely
radical & violent abolitionist. And frankly, this took a backseat to the
minmaxing.

## General play

Money is everything. Well, it's training, and training is essential to minmaxing
in TES3, for the easiest and most efficient 3x5 leveling. You need *lots of
money* for training.

You also need *lots of money* for persuasion (of trainers mainly), at least
until you've maxed Personality and Speechcraft.

Fortunately, it's not so hard to get to a point where you are constantly
bombarded with massive piles of incredibly valuable loot. So much loot, in fact,
that you will begin to simply leave the glass armor & weapons where you find
them, because you just don't need all that money right now.

1. Survive.
2. Make money.
3. Level efficiently.

All guidance below assumes you are also being careful to watch your major/minor
skills and level efficiently with the help of appropriate trainers.

I recommend leveling on Strength, Agility, and Endurance until one maxes to 100
(at about level 10), and then you finish maxing the other two while hitting Luck
each level up from then on out. Each time you max an attribute to 100, pick
another one to focus on.

## Starting build

Minmaxed builds tend to converge when 3x5 leveling and trainers are used.
However, it's important to start off on the right foot. Otherwise, growth will
be annoying. And minimizing annoyance is part of the goal here.

- Race
  - **Breton**
    - For the Resist Magicka 50. Essential to the laziness of the build.
- Starsign
  - **The Lady**
    - Endurance is great for maxing HP, and the Personality will help you spend
      a little less money on persuasion.
- Custom class
  - Favored attributes
    - **Agility**
      - You will fight a lot. Early on, you need to hit more than you miss.
    - **Strength**
      - You will fight a lot. Early on, when you hit, you need to hit hard. You
        also want to carry loot.
  - Major skills
    - **Axe**
      - Bound Battleaxe.
    - **Marksman**
      - Bonemold longbow, then daedric longbow.
    - **Light Armor**
      - Dark Brotherhood surplus & BoBS. Then CotSH for total Resist Magicka
        110 through to late game.
    - **Sneak**
      - Damage x4. And stealing.
    - **Mercantile**
      - You will be bribing, buying, and selling, *a lot*.
  - Minor skills
    - **Enchant**
      - Only for efficient use & recharge of enchanted items. You will never
        enchant something yourself.
    - **Athletics**
      - Keep fatigue high.
    - **Acrobatics**
      - Reach odd spots, and escape tight spots.
    - **Armorer**
      - Lots of fighting.
    - **Security**
      - Locks, until you get a custom Open 100 enchant. Then traps.
  - Other skills
    - **Speechcraft**
      - Eventually, you'll want to replace your bribes with words.

## Early game

- Grab a decent axe in a hollow log near the Seyda Neen lighthouse.
- Go to Balmora and deliver the package and get help from Cosades and all the
  Blades members.
- Join the Thieves' Guild and the Mages' Guild. You might also join the
  Fighter's Guild for the free potions, but do TG & MG quests, not FG quests.
- Scrape the barrels and boxes and towers of Balmora, Caldera, Ald'ruhn, and
  Vivec for loot.
  - Reserve some basic armor from this loot.
  - Ideally, find a bonemold longbow to keep for a Bound Battleaxe enchant.
  - Sell as much of this (and any other loot) as you can to Creeper in Caldera.
  - You can sell ingredients to Ajira, books to traders.
- From here, try to have 1 or 2 sujamma in reserve on your person at all times.
- When you feel ready for a tangle with a Dark Brotherhood assassin, find a bed
  and rest.
  - Win the fight and wear the armor.
  - If you get more visitors in the night, sell their stuff. It's light and
    quite valuable.
- Go find and kill the sketchy merchant with the BoBS on the road northwest of
  Caldera.
  - For now, only wear them when you aren't fighting. Eventually, you'll get the
    CotSH and the blindness won't be a problem.
- At some point, you can visit the Vassir-Didanat mine and report its location
  to the hidden Hlaalu guy in Vivec, to get a free daedric longbow.
- Also at some point, you can go up to Gnisis, then north up to a path
  intersection near a small pond and a bridge, where you can kill a couple
  bandits who try to trick you, obtaining the Amulet of Shadows.
- You can get a couple amulets of Divine & Almsivi intervention from a quick
  quest on the road along the north edge of Lake Amaya.
  - There's an Amulet of Recall for sale at the trader in Caldera, but I don't
    recall where I found an Amulet of Mark. Apparently there's one on a
    mid-level boss NPC near Gnaar Mok. Doesn't matter, it's better (and pretty
    simple) to have an T-ring enchanted with it.

## Middle game

- Daedric shrine north of Indoranyon, good spot for grinding daedra at the
  entrance. Mark here, then DI to Sadrith Mora, then recall back.
- Once you have the custom Ring of Open (or less likely an Ekash scroll), go to
  Tel Fyr with some Levitate potions and get the CotSH.
- You can do Larrius Varro's quest to purge the Camonna Tong in Balmora to
  obtain the Ring of Surroundings. Together with the Amulet of Shadows, it's
  easy access to full Chameleon.

## Equipment

In addition to fancy gear that is more or less permanently equipped on your
person, you'll want to have an inventory of enchanted items (some custom, some
found) to handle common challenges. You'll equip a selection of these items to
meet the moment, as appropriate.

You won't be able to find or create all of these immediately, but they're things
to search for and/or work toward.

### Custom

Lots of rings, because they're light and can hold large enchantments.

Several of these enchants can hold "filler" effects (usually Fortify Strength
for a couple points or so) to reach the maximum enchantment size for the item.
For items "smaller" than X-*, you can upgrade the item for more "room" for
fillers. This is only recommended for CE enchants.

Some items might be hard to find (e.g. daedric tower shield), in which case you
can substitute a similar but more common item (e.g. daedric shield).

You might want to reduce the magnitude of some enchants, e.g. Bound Battleaxe,
to reduce the casting cost when the longer duration or larger magnitude wouldn't
usually be helpful. For example, a melee encounter might take 30s or less, so
the cost-benefit ratio might not be sensible for a 400s duration on a bound
battleaxe. On the other hand, for high Enchant skill and large souls, there
might not be a good reason to hold back on the better effect. Another example is
the custom Ring of Open. Using Touch instead of Target halves the casting cost.
