## Why

In late 2023, I set out to cheese TES3 as hard as I could. But also as lazily as
I could. Laborious exploits and alchemical trickery were shunned. I wanted the
build to require as little button-pushing as possible, while also being able to
steamroll through every corner of Vvardenfell, Mournhold, and Solstheim. Like
speedrunning, but minimizing number of inputs rather than minimizing time.

I succeeded.

What follows here is a very rough guide to repeat what I did, but more lazily
and more powerfully. More cheesily. And what's more, with **no alchemy** and
with **no spell-*casting***. Found and store-bought potions and scrolls are
fine, as well as any (including custom) enchanted items. I think the path laid
out here is one that can be followed relatively easily on difficulty 100.

If you like RP builds, this is probably not an approach you would like. I
wouldn't say I did no RP, but the most RP thing I did was to be an extremely
radical & violent abolitionist. And frankly, this took a backseat to the
minmaxing.

## General play

**Money is everything.** Well, it's training, and training is essential to minmaxing
in TES3, for the easiest and most efficient 3x5 leveling. You need *lots of
money* for training.

You also need *lots of money* for persuasion (of trainers mainly), at least
until you've maxed Personality and Speechcraft.

Fortunately, it's not so hard to get to a point where you are constantly
bombarded with massive piles of incredibly valuable loot. So much loot, in fact,
that you will begin to simply leave the glass armor & weapons where you find
them, because you just don't need all that money right now.

1. Survive.
2. Make money.
3. Level efficiently.

All guidance below assumes you are also being careful to watch your major/minor
skills and level efficiently with the help of appropriate trainers.

I recommend leveling on *Personality* (for maxing Mercantile ASAP), Agility, and
Endurance until Personality maxes to 100 (at about level 8 with the Lady
starsign), then you replace that "slot" with Strength, then on the next max
(should be Endurance) you start leveling Luck plus any two (prioritizing
Agility, Strength, Speed, Intelligence). Each time you max an attribute to
100, pick another one to focus on.

This build's only leveling armor skill is Light Armor, but you'll want to have
your Medium Armor and Heavy Armor trained up as you discover higher-level gear
(see below).

By the time you're leveled into the high 20s *(edit: during testing, realizing
this point can be reached by level 5 or possibly earlier...)*, you'll probably
have enough loot laid away to buy all your remaining levels through trainers.
The trainers will need to be found, and the hostile ones will need calming &
persuasion.

## Starting build

Minmaxed builds tend to converge when 3x5 leveling and trainers are used.
However, it's important to start off on the right foot. Otherwise, growth will
be annoying. And minimizing annoyance is part of the goal here.

- Race
  - **Breton**
    - Mainly for the Resist Magicka 50. With early-game retrieval of the CotSH,
      this is essential to the laziness of the build.
    - But also for the Dragon Skin ability, which is a great bootstrapper for
      the very early game.
- Starsign
  - **The Lady**
    - Endurance is great for maxing HP, and the Personality will help you spend
      a little less money on persuasion.
- Custom class
  - Specialization
    - **Stealth**
      - You'll be doing a lot of combat, but your most important early game
        skills are in stealth.
  - Favored attributes
    - **Agility**
      - You will fight a lot. Early on, you need to hit more than you miss.
    - **Strength**
      - You will fight a lot. Early on, when you hit, you need to hit hard. You
        also want to carry as much loot as possible as early as possible.
  - Major skills
    - **Axe**
      - BBa-enchanted bow.
    - **Marksman**
      - Daedric bow from Dram Bero.
    - **Light Armor**
      - Dark Brotherhood surplus & BoBS. Then CotSH for total Resist Magicka
        110 through to late game.
    - **Sneak**
      - Damage x4. And stealing.
    - **Mercantile**
      - You will be bribing, buying, and selling, *a lot*.
  - Minor skills
    - **Enchant**
      - Only for efficient use & recharge of enchanted items. You will never
        enchant something yourself.
    - **Athletics**
      - Keep fatigue high.
    - **Acrobatics**
      - Reach odd spots, and escape tight spots.
    - **Armorer**
      - Lots of fighting.
    - **Security**
      - Locks, until you get a custom Open 100 enchant. Then traps.
  - Other skills
    - **Speechcraft**
      - Eventually, you'll want to replace your bribes with words.

## Starting out

> If you're playing at high/max difficulty (and perhaps even if you're not),
> it's always a good idea to drink a sujamma or two before combat.

- Equip yourself thusly:
  - Grab a "shard axe" (iron battleaxe enchanted with some variable frost
    damage) from a hollow log next to the Seyda Neen lighthouse. This will
    require a couple small jumps.
  - Go to Balmora. Deliver the package to Caius. Join the TG, FG, and MG. Grab
    the health and fatigue potions from the FG.
  - With your Dragon Skin ability ready to immediately cast, go rest in a bed
    (e.g. in the MG basement) until a Dark Brotherhood assassin attacks you.
    Modulo drinking potions to stay alive and at high fatigue, cast Dragon Skin
    and then kill the assassin. Equip the assassin's armor.
  - Guide-travel to Caldera and walk northwest along the road until you
    encounter the sketchy trader with the BoBS. Agree to escort her, then turn
    around and kill her. Take her stuff and, unless you're in combat (until you
    have the CotSH), wear the boots.
    - **DO NOT FORGET TO TAKE OFF THESE BOOTS FOR COMBAT!!!** (until you get the
      CotSH...)
  - Go to Vassir-Didanat Mine, enter and immediately leave, then go to Dram Bero
    in Vivec (St. Olm's canton plaza "haunted" manor, through a locked door with
    a good pick found in the same room). Tell him about the mine, then choose
    the daedric long bow.
    - You'll need about 5k gp to get a max BBa enchantment on this bow. Once you
      have the BBa, ditch the shard axe.

## Early game

> Messy notes to integrate later: Forget the Ring of Surroundings. Buy a
> Shadowweave Ring from Irgola (Caldera) to complement the Amulet of Shadows (if
> it's a fixed item in that vendor's inventory?), then use the AoS (or maybe
> also the SwR) to go get a Shadowmask Ring (**actually a Ring of
> Surroundings???**) from Dren Plantation, Tower Shack (and if you kill the guy
> there, he's apparently got a daedric dai-katana, worth 120k, which is nice but
> useless until you get some smaller denominations built up in Creeper's
> inventory). Also, don't level Strength to start. Level Personality instead,
> until you get to 100. In your leveling skills, train only Mercantile.
> Otherwise train Spear and Block. Buy the Amulet of Recall from Verick. Buy a
> Potion of Marking from Nalcarya (in Balmora). Carefully make your way
> (avoiding isolated Ashlander camps and wildlife) to Zainab Camp and bribe
> Abibael Timsar-Dadisun up to 100 Disposition (definitely can cheese the
> persuasion a little by making a ton of small Barter transactions with him).
> Mark in the middle of Zainab Camp. Use Amulet of DI to extract yourself to
> Sadrith Mora and guild-guide from there. Use Amulet of Recall to get back to
> Zainab when you level up and need Mercantile training again. ALWAYS MAINTAIN
> SOME LIQUIDITY. Do not overspend on training. You need the liquidity to apply
> persuasion during quests. But also: Once you have the 100+ Chameleon, you can
> go raid the Tower of Dusk at Ghostgate for a ton of glass equipment. (You
> still have to sneak! They can still spot you if you're too obvious...) There's
> also a few pieces of ebony armor in the Tower of Dawn vault. Once you have
> this loot... you're basically set. The game will be, temporarily, all about
> cashing it in with Creeper (and possibly Mudcrab Merchant, but he's out in the
> boonies), and then flitting hither and thither for training.

- **The immediate goal is the CotSH.**
  - You will need a lot of money, primarily for a very expensive
    custom-enchanted "Ring of Open" (Open 100 on Touch), about 15k gp. This ring
    can be a general tool, but it's specifically meant for the armoire in Tel
    Fyr that contains the CotSH. You probably don't need a huge soul for the
    enchanting, but do try to get the largest soul you can reasonably find.
    Minimum soul size 100 probably. Keep in mind that you will need at least a
    T-ring to hold this enchantment.
  - To get up to the top floor of the Tel Fyr tower, you'll also need one or
    more potions and/or scrolls of levitate and/or jump. Fortunately, there are
    two potions of levitate waiting for you on a shelf in the lower level of the
    area which calls for them.
- **To facilitate looting** and the completion of some quests, you will want the
  **Amulet of Shadows** from the bandits north of Gnisis. Top this off with the
  Ring of Surroundings from Larrius Varro (or the Dren plantation tower shack),
  and you're basically all set for stealth work. A single ring with 100
  Chameleon is more convenient, but this will do fine for now.
  - [TEST] Varro's quest is easier if you have the Ring of FrenzyH (about 3k
    gp). Your early speechcraft is garbage and bribing will get annoying and/or
    impossible if you try to prep taunt attempts with high disposition.
    - Big problem. Frenzy on any of the 3 central thugs will trigger all of
      them. On max difficulty, that's a big problem. Might be better to simply
      sneak and murder with Amulet of Shadows. Maybe also the potion of shadow
      to pull the whole deed off. More problems, though: Low agility means I
      can't hit these dudes even when sneaking.
- You can get a couple amulets of Divine & Almsivi intervention as a reward for
  an MG quest given by the guild leader in Ald'ruhn.
  - There's an Amulet of Recall for sale at the trader in Caldera, but I don't
    recall where I found an Amulet of Mark. Apparently there's one on a
    mid-level boss NPC near Gnaar Mok. Doesn't matter, it's better (and pretty
    simple) to have a T-ring enchanted with it.
- Favor TG quests over FG quests. Otherwise do whatever you want.
- Sell loot to Creeper (in Caldera). He won't buy unenchanted clothing, books,
  paper, light sources, ingredients, or alchemy equipment. You can sell that
  other stuff to any trader, e.g. Verick Gemain (in Caldera).
  - You can steal (even openly) the orcish armor in a crate on the top floor of
    Ghorak Manor. It's very valuable at this point, and Creeper is right there
    waiting to buy it.
  - Later, when Creeper's funds are too limited and you have easier access to
    the Mudcrab Merchant, you can try going to the latter as well. He doesn't
    buy quite as broadly as Creeper, but he has twice the funds. (Plus a little
    restocking supply of sujamma.)
- You can get repeated visits from Dark Brotherhood assassins until you go talk
  to a guy in the Ebonheart castle yard about going to Mournhold. This can be
  good, and it can be bad. Good for the loot. Bad if you're unable to handle the
  potentially multiple assassins that can arrive all at once.
- Try to get a Ring of Charm 50/2s or so. Bribing is nice, but it's best for
  folks with whom you will have repeated dealings. Like trainers. One-off
  interactions (e.g. for quests) are best handled with a long-term cheaper
  method.

## Middle game

- Daedric shrine north of Indoranyon, good spot for grinding daedra at the
  entrance (by exiting the shrine in sneak mode, assassinating the daedra
  immediately in front of you, then rinse-repeat). To remove loot and return
  easily, you can mark here, then DI to Sadrith Mora, then recall back.

## Equipment GOALS

In addition to fancy gear that is more or less permanently equipped on your
person, you'll want to have an inventory of enchanted items (some custom, some
found) to handle common challenges. You'll equip a selection of these items to
meet the moment, as appropriate.

You won't be able to find or create all of these immediately, but they're things
to search for and/or work toward.

Several of the custom-enchanted items below can hold "filler" effects (usually
Fortify Strength for a couple points or so) to reach the maximum enchantment
size for the item. For items "smaller" than Q-*, you can upgrade the item for
more "room" for fillers. This is only recommended for CE enchants.

Some items might be hard to find (e.g. daedric tower shield), in which case you
can substitute a similar but more common item (e.g. daedric shield).

You might want to reduce the magnitude of some enchants, e.g. BBa, to reduce the
casting cost when the longer duration or larger magnitude wouldn't usually be
helpful. For example, a melee encounter might take 30s or less, so the
cost-benefit ratio might not be sensible for a 400s duration on a bound
battleaxe. On the other hand, for high Enchant skill and large souls, there
might not be a good reason to hold back on the better effect. Another example is
the custom Ring of Open. Using Touch instead of Target halves the casting cost.

### Utility belt

The "found" items are generally things you'll encounter early and then replace
with the custom-enchanted items.

#### Found

| Name                 | Effect(s)                        | Trigger |

#### Custom-enchanted

Lots of rings, because they're light and can hold large enchantments.

Some of these have relatively accessible and cheap counterparts among the
vendors and loot you'll find. (Amulets, clothing, etc.) If necessary, feel free
to use whatever is at hand. These are listed here as "the ideal" in that they
are all as light as possible while achieving the desired effect.
